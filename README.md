## Introduction 

This project was made by Guim Casadell√†, Gerard Grau, Marc Herrero & Pol Resina for the Inditex TECH challenge at the 10th edition of [hackupc](https://hackupc.com/).

## Problem setting & approach

### Problem setting

At Inditex, the world's largest fashion retailer, 

### Approach

Due to problem complexity, we have decided to apply a AI-based solution. We have used a pre-trained model, CLIP, to understand the context of the image. 

## CLIP: We have used a pre-trained model to understand the context of the image.

## Semantic Segmentation: We have used a pre-trained model to identify the drivable area in clothing. This is a crucial step to understand the environment arou

Semantic segmentation is commonly used in computer vision in which the goal is to categorize each pixel in an image into a class or object. Nowadays, one of the most famous applications is autonomous driving, where the car needs to understand the environment around it. In this project, however, we have used semantic segmentation to identify the drivable area in clothing.
